## About Me

Hi, my name is Hyeonsu Lee. I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience from KAIST (â€™24.08, Advisor: Prof. Se-Bum Paik) and currently joined KIST (Advisor: Dr. Jaeson Jang). I received a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences and an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST, where I developed a deep interest in understanding how neural activity in small brain circuits can efficiently enable complex cognitive functions.
