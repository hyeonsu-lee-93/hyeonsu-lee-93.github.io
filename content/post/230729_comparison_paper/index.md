Dr. Choi and I published a paper demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of quantity comparison ability. <br>
Our research showed that single neurons tuned to ratios and differences in visual quantities arise spontaneously in completely untrained neural networks, enabling the network to perform quantity comparison tasks. <br>
I am deeply grateful for the guidance and supervision of Prof. Se-Bum Paik.
