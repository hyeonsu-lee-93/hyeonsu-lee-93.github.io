My mentee, Suhee Cho, and I recently posted a preprint presenting a metaplasticity model inspired by human working memory. <br>
In this study, based on my previous work [(Lee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.09.034), we implemented distinct types of synapses from stable to flexible, and randomly intermixing them to train synaptic connections with varying degrees of flexibility.
We found that our model achieved a balanced tradeoff between memory capacity and performance without requiring additional training or structural modifications, dynamically allocating memory resources to retain both old and new information. <br>

I am deeply grateful for the invaluable guidance and supervision of Prof. Se-Bum Paik.
