	abstract = {The ability to compare quantities of visual objects with two distinct measures, proportion and difference, is observed even in newborn animals. However, how this function originates in the brain, even before visual experience, remains unknown. Here, we propose a model in which neuronal tuning for quantity comparisons can arise spontaneously in completely untrained neural circuits. Using a biologically inspired model neural network, we ﬁnd that single units selective to proportions and differences between visual quantities emerge in randomly initialized feedforward wirings and that they enable the network to perform quantity comparison tasks. Notably, we ﬁnd that two distinct tunings to proportion and difference originate from a random summation of monotonic, nonlinear neural activities and that a slight difference in the nonlinear response function determines the type of measure. Our results suggest that visual quantity comparisons are primitive types of functions that can emerge spontaneously before learning in young brains.},
